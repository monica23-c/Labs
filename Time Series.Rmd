## What is Time Series?

<ul>

<li>Previously, you learned how to create bargraphs, histograms, and scatterplots.</li>

<li>The best visualization depended on the types of the variables - for instance, bargraphs were best for a single categorical variable, histograms were best for a single numerical variable, and scatterplots were best for two numerical variables. All of these plots could be faceted to accommodate an additional categorical variable.</li>

<li>In this lab, we'll learn the best way to visualize a variable that was measured over time, also known as a <b>time series</b>.</li>

</ul>

## Load the data

<ul>

<li>Type the following commands into your console:</li>

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
data(flights)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
?flights
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
str(flights)
```

<li><span style="color: red;"> What kind of variable is <span style="color: blue;">date</span>?</span></li>

</ul>

## Creating Time Series Plots

<ul>

<li><b>Time series plots</b> are useful for visualizing time series, allowing you to view how a variable changes over time.</li>

<li>Recall the <span style="color: blue;">xyplot</span> function, which was used to produce scatterplots from two numeric variables. This function can also be used to create time series plots from a <b>Date</b> variable and a numeric variable. (We call <span style="color: blue;">xyplot</span> <b>polymorphic</b> because it can handle arguments of different types.)</li>

<li><span style="color: red;">Suppose we are interested in examining how <span style="color: blue;">total_operations</span> changes over time for each <span style="color: blue;">airport</span>. Fill in the blanks to create a time series plot with <span style="color: blue;">total_operations</span> on the y-axis and <span style="color: blue;">date</span> on the x-axis, faceting by <span style="color: blue;">airport</span>.</span></li>

<li>Note: Since a time series tracks how a variable changes over time, it makes sense to connect successive data points with a line. Include the argument <span style="color: blue;">type = "l"</span> to do this. </li>

</ul>

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
xyplot(_____ ~ _____|_____, data = _____, type = _____)
```

## Zoom in on Atlanta

<ul>

<li>Suppose we would like to focus on the airport in Atlanta (<span style="color: blue;">ATL</span>). <span style="color: red;">Start by using the <span style="color: blue;">filter</span> function to extract the data from the airport in Atlanta, and call this new dataset <span style="color: blue;">ATL_flights</span>.</li>

<li><span style="color: red;">Create a time series plot with <span style="color: blue;">total_operations</span> on the y-axis and <span style="color: blue;">date</span> on the x-axis, using <span style="color: blue;">ATL_flights</span>.</li>

## Further Exploration

<li><span style="color: red;">Do you notice any patterns in the first two weeks of March?</span> (hint: are any dates noticeably less busy than other dates? On what days of the week do these lulls occur?)</li>

<li><span style="color: red;">Do other airports exhibit patterns similar to those of the airport in Atlanta?</span></li>

</ul>
